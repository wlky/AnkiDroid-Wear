## Pre-Releases

The second method is to manually download and install the releases. You will have to do this manually after every release, but the benefit is, that you don't have to wait for Google Play to publish the update (which can take up to a day)

- Download the AnkiWear app from the Google Play store

### Method 2 - Directly download the .apk files
