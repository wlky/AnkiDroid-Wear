## Pre-Releases
There are two methods to get pre-releases of AnkiWear. The first method is to become a google play alpha tester. This way new updates will automatically be installed on your device, as you are used to by normal apps. <br/>
The second method is to manually download and install the releases. You will have to do this manually after every release, but the benefit is, that you don't have to wait for Google Play to publish the update (which can take up to a day)


### Method 1 - Use the Google Play alpha channel

- Download the AnkiWear app from the Google Play store

### Method 2 - Directly download the .apk files
This app only works with the development version of the AnkiDroid app
- Download and install the latest release of AnkiWear here: https://github.com/wlky/AnkiDroid-Wear/releases
- After a couple of seconds this should also automatically install the "Anki" app on your watch
